[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

The heroku branch is designed just to look for free games on steam at the moment,
but I will be adding support to change notifcations.

The app needs you to have an e-mail account to send the notifications from,
I use a new gmail account I created just for the app. 
You may need to allow less secure control to your gmail in account preferences.

Once Heroku is finished deploying, make sure you click on the resources tab, then the pencil, and finally the toggle switch to start.

To confirm the app is running, in the upper right corner click more, and then view logs.
