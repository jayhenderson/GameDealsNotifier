# Reddit-Notifier
A notification bot for reddit

Create a email.ini file based on the email.ini.example

If using a gmail account to send, you may need to allow less secure apps to access the server.

In run.py you can edit the target subreddit and the lists of words to allow/disallow.

Once these are configured just run the app and it will notify you via email of new posts meeting your criteria.
